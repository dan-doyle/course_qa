Why is this course for me?
Do you have a curious mindset and a thirst for knowledge about the world around you? This course is for you! Statistics is the science of transforming data into knowledge and understanding, and provides a principled approach to making data-informed decisions. As we live through a data revolution, with every sector of the economy, science, and society routinely producing vast amounts of data, the demand for data analytic skills is higher than ever. From finance to healthcare, tech to sports, expertise in statistics is essential for shaping the future of these industries.
At UCD, Statistics goes beyond simply teaching students how to use data analytics methods and algorithms. We also focus on providing a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mathematical principles behind statistical analyses. By combining methods, theory, programming, and data from real-world applications, our graduates are equipped not just to use existing data analytics tools, but to develop new ones as well. This is a highly sought-after mastery, given the fast-paced, ever-changing nature of the data science field. With this degree you will be part of the statisticians and data scientists of the future who will shape how data are employed in society, sciences, and economy.
Information on all our courses including pathways, internships and careers information is available in the UCD Science Undergraduate Courses Entry 2025 Brochure (PDF).

What Will I Study?
Students study similar modules for all degree subjects in the Mathematics stream in first year and will study modules for a minimum of two degree subjects in second year. At the end of second year, students choose their degree subject. As we offer a number of degree subjects in each stream, students have a number of similar degree subjects to choose from and if a degree subject is oversubscribed, places are allocated on a competitive basis. For more information on choosing a degree subject at the end of Second Year, visit the Mathematics stream page.

Testimonial
UCD gave me the flexibility to see what type of Maths subject I enjoyed the most. I was able to try Physics, Mathematics, Statistics and even Chemistry – before deciding to major in Statistics. I love getting to see Mathematics applied to real-world data and establishing patterns and reasonings behind different outcomes. I am also Secretary of the Trampoline Club, which I joined back in first year and have made some of my closest friends through the club! In my summer of third year, I completed an internship in data analytics and after I graduated, I started work as a data analyst.
