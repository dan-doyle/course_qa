Why is this course for me?
Mathematics is a universal language and a tool of fundamental importance in the physical and social sciences, engineering, technology, computer science, statistics, finance, data analytics and many other fields. The subject is thousands of years old and yet thoroughly modern. In the past 100 years the growth of mathematics has been spectacular, stimulated not only by the needs of science, technology and commerce, but also by intellectual challenges provided by the discipline itself. The interplay between mathematics and neighbouring subjects continues to yield many fascinating problems that require creative solutions. If you find mathematics interesting and enjoyable then this degree subject could be for you.
Information on all our courses including pathways, internships and careers information is available in the UCD Science Undergraduate Courses Entry 2025 Brochure (PDF).

What Will I Study?
Mathematics is one of the degree subjects available through the Mathematics stream in the common entry Science course. Students study similar modules for all degree subjects in the Mathematics stream in first year and will study modules for a minimum of two degree subjects in second year. At the end of second year, students choose their degree subject. As we offer a number of degree subjects in each stream, students have a number of similar degree subjects to choose from and if a degree subject is oversubscribed, places are allocated on a competitive basis. For more information on choosing a degree subject at the end of Second Year, visit the Mathematics stream page.
This is a sample set of modules that a Mathematics student could study each year in UCD. 
First Year
Scientific Enquiry • Introduction to Applied & Computational Mathematics • Calculus in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences • Applications of Differential Equations • Linear Algebra in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences • Statistical Modelling • Mathematical Analysis • Numbers & Functions • Option Modules • Elective Module
Second Year
Computational Science • Calculus of Several Variables • Linear Algebra in the Mathematical Sciences • Introduction to Probability • Vector Calculus • Groups, Rings and Fields • Inferential Statistics • + modules for 1 other Subject • Elective Modules
Third Year
Advanced Linear Algebra • Metric Spaces • Measure Theory • Complex Analysis • Topology • Further Groups & Rings • Option Modules • Elective modules
Fourth Year
Final Year Project • Differential Geometry • Functional Analysis • Probability Theory • Algebraic Geometry • Galois Theory • Number Theory • Option Modules
Timetables & Assessment
Each student will have their own timetable based on their individual module selection. This is a full-time course and classes may include lectures, practicals and tutorials, depending on the subjects. Students will also be expected to study independently (autonomous student learning). Assessment varies with each module but may comprise continuous assessment of practicals, written exams and online learning activities.

International Study Opportunities
Students may apply to study abroad for a trimester in third year in partner institutions internationally.

Career & Graduate Study Opportunities
Each year sees new applications of sophisticated mathematical models and procedures in insurance and actuarial services, data analytics, the stock market, banking and industry. Employers in all of these areas seek mathematics graduates for their critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
Our recent graduates are working in many diverse areas, including actuarial science, banking and financial services, civil service, coding and cryptography companies, IT industry, meteorology and research.
Opportunities for further study include MSc and PhD programmes in the mathematical sciences in Ireland and abroad, leading to research positions in universities or industry.

Testimonial
I decided to study at UCD due to its beautiful campus, unparalleled facilities, and the ability to tailor my degree to what interested me most. My favourite part of studying Mathematics is learning to look at a complicated logical problem and slowly teasing out the solution through different approaches. The variety in assessment of projects, assignments and exams helped ensure I understood topics in theory and practice. Being involved in the Literary & Historical society and the Women+ in STEM society has helped me meet an incredible group of friends and has aided me in developing a wide variety of extracurricular skills.
