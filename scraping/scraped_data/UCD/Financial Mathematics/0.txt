Why is this course for me?
If you have a strong interest in Mathematics, enjoy problem solving and are interested in how Mathematics is used in business and finance, Financial Mathematics will give you an understanding of the mathematical theories that underpin financial models, as well as computational expertise in the algorithms used to price financial products. One example of a financial model included in the course is the Black-Scholes option pricing model, dating from 1973, which is one of the earliest equations developed and used to price options. Implementations of financial models, including computer programming, form a key part of the course.
Information on all our courses including pathways, internships and careers information is available in the UCD Science Undergraduate Courses Entry 2025 Brochure (PDF).

What Will I Study?
Financial Mathematics is one of the degree subjects available through the Mathematics stream in the common entry Science course. Students study similar modules for all degree subjects in the Mathematics stream in first year and will study modules for a minimum of two degree subjects in second year. At the end of second year, students choose their degree subject. As we offer a number of degree subjects in each stream, students have a number of similar degree subjects to choose from and if a degree subject is oversubscribed, places are allocated on a competitive basis. For more information on choosing a degree subject at the end of Second Year, visit the Mathematics stream page.
This is a sample set of modules that a Financial Mathematics student could study each year in UCD.
First Year
Scientific Enquiry • Introduction to Applied & Computational Mathematics • Calculus in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences • Applications of Differential Equations • Linear Algebra in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences • Statistical Modelling • Mathematical Analysis • Numbers & Functions • Microeconomics for Business • Option Modules • Elective Module
Second Year
Computational Science • Calculus of Several Variables • Linear Algebra in the Mathematical Sciences • Introduction to Probability • Foundations of Finance • Modern Regression Analysis • + modules for 1 other Science Subject • Elective Modules
Third Year
Partial Differential Equations in Financial Maths • Corporate Financial Management • Fundamentals of Actuarial Mathematics • Metric Spaces • Stochastic Models • Advanced Computational Finance • Financial Maths Foundations • Option Modules • Elective Modules
Fourth Year
Measure Theory & Integration • Time Series Analysis • Monte Carlo Inference • Financial & Actuarial Maths • Advanced Risk Management • Probability Theory • Option Modules
Timetables & Assessment
Each student will have their own timetable based on their individual module selection. This is a full-time course and classes may include lectures, practicals and tutorials, depending on the subjects. Students will also be expected to study independently (autonomous student learning). Assessment varies with each module but may comprise continuous assessment of practicals, written exams and online learning activities.

Testimonial
When I learned about Financial Mathematics, it sounded like the perfect way to continue to study mathematics while also combining it with my interest in financial markets. I was also lucky enough to get to go abroad for my third year to UC Berkeley in California, which was an amazing experience. Studying at a different institution gave me another perspective and I think it really helped me in my final year. I also completed an internship in the summer after third year as part of the professional placement module. After graduating, I went back to work at the same firm full time.
