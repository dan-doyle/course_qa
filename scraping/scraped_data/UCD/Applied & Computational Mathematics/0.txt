Why is this course for me?
If you enjoy studying Mathematics for the Leaving Certificate, Applied & Computational Mathematics at UCD will train you in the essential mathematical and computational skills in modelling, analysis and simulation needed to solve problems arising throughout the physical and life sciences, engineering, business and finance sectors. Today’s challenges faced by science and engineering are so complex that they can be analysed and solved only through mathematical and computational modelling. Mathematical models create representations of complex real-world phenomena in a precise, quantitative way. Fundamental insights can then be obtained by analysing these models through a combination of mathematical analysis and computational simulation. Outside the traditional spheres of science and engineering, mathematical modelling and simulation techniques are increasingly used in the social sciences, communication, business and finance sectors.
Information on all our courses including pathways, internships and careers information is available in the UCD Science Undergraduate Courses Entry 2025 Brochure (PDF).

What Will I Study?
Applied & Computational Mathematics is one of the degree subjects available through the Mathematics stream in the common entry Science course.
Students study similar modules for all degree subjects in the Mathematics stream in first year and will study modules for a minimum of two degree subjects in second year. At the end of second year, students choose their degree subject. As we offer a number of degree subjects in each stream, students have a number of similar degree subjects to choose from and if a degree subject is oversubscribed, places are allocated on a competitive basis. For more information on choosing a degree subject at the end of Second Year, visit the Mathematics stream page.
This is a sample set of modules that an Applied & Computational Mathematics student could study each year in UCD.
First Year
Scientific Enquiry • Introduction to Applied & Computational Mathematics • Calculus in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences • Applications of Differential Equations • Linear Algebra in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences • Statistical Modelling • Mathematical Analysis • Numbers & Functions • Option Modules • Elective Module 
Second Year
Computational Science • Classical Mechanics • Calculus of Several Variables • Introduction to Probability • Oscillations & Waves • Vector Calculus • + modules for 1 other Subject • Elective Modules
Third Year
Advanced Computational Science • Advanced Mathematical Methods • Complex Analysis • Partial Differential Equations • Mathematical Biology • Metric Spaces • Numerical Methods • Dynamical Systems • Option Modules • Elective modules
Fourth Year
Research Project • Mathematics of Complex Networks • Mathematics of Machine Learning • General Relativity & Black Holes • Mathematical Fluid Dynamics • Option Modules 
Timetables & Assessment
Each student will have their own timetable based on their individual module selection. This is a full-time course and classes may include lectures, practicals and tutorials, depending on the subjects. Students will also be expected to study independently (autonomous student learning). Assessment varies with each module but may comprise continuous assessment of practicals, written exams and online learning activities.

Testimonial
After my first Applied & Computational Mathematics class, I knew it was the right choice for me. The chance to study the mechanics and structure of Mathematics and learn how to apply it to not just Physics and Computer Science but to a wide range of other fields was thrilling. That, along with my time spent as a class representative, was so rewarding; getting to organise events, trips and hoodies for my class. As well as this, UCD Science gave me the opportunity to spend a trimester studying abroad in California, broadening my perspective and giving me a more varied education.
